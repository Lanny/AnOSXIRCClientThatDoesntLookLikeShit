# An OSX IRC Client That Doesn't Look Like Shit: AOICTDLLS

Seriously guys, colloquy looks like the devs haven't touched the UI in half a
decade, textual costs money and isn't much better, limechat's window splitting
freaks me the hell out, XChat is a passable port but the tabbing is lame and
god only knows which features work and which don't, and finally if I wanted a
curses client I wouldn't be paying the premium for OSX eye candy. The worst
part is that on top the poor visuals most of these clients have broken DCC
support. I figure if all you need to support is the most commonly used IRC
features to be a major client I might as well make one that's easy on the eyes.
Thus is born An OSX IRC Client That Doesn't Look Like Shit.

## TODO
